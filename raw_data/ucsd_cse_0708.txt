Courses
For course descriptions not found in the 2007-2008 General Catalog, please contact the department for more information.
Student demand exceeds capacity in many CSE courses. Accordingly, many CSE undergraduate courses may have enrollment restrictions which give priority to students in the following order:

CSE majors, CSE M.S., and CSE Ph.D. students
CSE pre-majors, ECE CE majors and pre-majors, and Math-CS majors
students fulfilling a non-elective requirement in another program
