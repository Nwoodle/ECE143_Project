227A. Introduction to Convex Optimization. (3)
Three hours of lecture per week. Convex optimization
is a class of nonlinear optimization problems where the
objective to be minimized, and the constraints, are both
convex. Contrarily to the more classical linear programming
framework, convex programs often go unrecognized,
and this is a pity since a large class of
convex optimization problems can now be efficiently
solved. In addition, it is possible to address hard, nonconvex
problems (such as “combinatorial optimization”
problems) using convex approximations that are more
efficient than classical linear ones. The 3-unit course
covers some convex optimization theory and algorithms,
and describes various applications arising in
engineering design, modelling and estimation, finance,
